## Problem Statement
Sberbank is challenging programmers to develop algorithms which use a broad spectrum of features to predict real prices. Algorithm applications rely on a rich dataset that includes housing data and macroeconomic patterns. An accurate forecasting model will allow Sberbank to provide more certainty to their customers in an uncertain economy.
## Data
The dataset can be downloaded from [Sberbank Russian Housing Market Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/sberbank-russian-housing-market).
