    "*The goal for this project is to identify students who might need early intervention before they fail to graduate. Which type of supervised learning problem is this, classification or regression? Why?*\n",
    "### Answer 1\n",
    "For simplicity, the border between regression and classification can be described in this way:\n",
    "\n",
    "- classification: predict the values of discrete or categorical targets;\n",
    "- regression: predict the values of continuous targets.\n",
    "\n",
    "This supervised learning problem is in the classification field. We should predict the labels for the students: 'yes' or 'no' for the feature 'passed'. "

    "1) GradientBoostingClassifier.\n",

    "  - Gradient boosting machines, a tutorial: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3885826/\n",
    "- Strengths: natural handling of data of mixed type (= heterogeneous features), predictive power, robustness to outliers in output space (via robust loss functions).\n",
    "- Weaknesses: scalability, due to the sequential nature of boosting it can hardly be parallelized.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) RandomForestClassifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Applications: in ecology, bioinformatics.\n",
    "  - RANDOM FORESTS FOR CLASSIFICATION IN ECOLOGY: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/07-0539.1/abstract;jsessionid=AB1864A895F3244AF0699EB0317F2C99.f02t02\n",
    "  - Random Forest for Bioinformatics: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~qyj/papersA08/11-rfbook.pdf\n",
    "- Strengths: runs efficiently on large data bases; gives estimates of what variables are important in the classification; maintains accuracy when a large proportion of the data are missing; high prediction accuracy.\n",
    "- Weaknesses: difficult to interpret, can be slow to evaluate.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) AdaBoostClassifier.\n",

    "- Strengths: can be used with data that is textual, numeric, discrete, etc.; can be combined with any other learning algorithm, not prone to overfitting; simple to implement.\n",
    "- Weaknesses: can be sensitive to noisy data and outliers; the performance depends on data and weak learner (can fail if weak classifiers too complex).\n",

    "In general, boosting in the machine learning is the construction a highly accurate prediction rule by combining many relatively weak and inaccurate rules. It based on the assumption: each of the weak hypotheses has accuracy a little bit better than a random guess. The AdaBoost algorithm unites weak classifiers in this way: the predictions from all of them are then combined through a weighted majority vote (or sum) to produce the final prediction. As many learning methods, AdaBoost uses minimizing a loss function that measures how well a model fits the observed data (more accurately - minimizing the exponential loss).\n",
