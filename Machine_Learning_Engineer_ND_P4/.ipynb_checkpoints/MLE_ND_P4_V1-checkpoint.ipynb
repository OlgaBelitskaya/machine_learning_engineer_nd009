    "In this project, we will work towards constructing an optimized Q-Learning driving agent that will navigate a *Smartcab* through its environment towards a goal. Since the *Smartcab* is expected to drive passengers from one location to another, the driving agent will be evaluated on two very important metrics: **Safety** and **Reliability**. A driving agent that gets the *Smartcab* to its destination while running red lights or narrowly avoiding accidents would be considered **unsafe**. Similarly, a driving agent that frequently fails to reach the destination in time would be considered **unreliable**. Maximizing the driving agent's **safety** and **reliability** would ensure that *Smartcabs* have a permanent place in the transportation industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Safety** and **Reliability** are measured using a letter-grade system as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Grade \t| Safety \t| Reliability \t|\n",
    "|:-----:\t|:------:\t|:-----------:\t|\n",
    "|   A+  \t|  Agent commits no traffic violations,<br/>and always chooses the correct action. | Agent reaches the destination in time<br />for 100% of trips. |\n",
    "|   A   \t|  Agent commits few minor traffic violations,<br/>such as failing to move on a green light. | Agent reaches the destination on time<br />for at least 90% of trips. |\n",
    "|   B   \t| Agent commits frequent minor traffic violations,<br/>such as failing to move on a green light. | Agent reaches the destination on time<br />for at least 80% of trips. |\n",
    "|   C   \t|  Agent commits at least one major traffic violation,<br/> such as driving through a red light. | Agent reaches the destination on time<br />for at least 70% of trips. |\n",
    "|   D   \t| Agent causes at least one minor accident,<br/> such as turning left on green with oncoming traffic.       \t| Agent reaches the destination on time<br />for at least 60% of trips. |\n",
    "|   F   \t|  Agent causes at least one major accident,<br />such as driving through a red light with cross-traffic.      \t| Agent fails to reach the destination on time<br />for at least 60% of trips. |\n",
    "\n",
    "To assist evaluating these important metrics, you will need to load visualization code that will be used later on in the project. Run the code cell below to import this code which is required for your analysis."

    "In a few sentences, describe what you observe during the simulation when running the default `agent.py` agent code. Some things you could consider:\n",

    "### Answer 1\n",
    "- &#x1F58C; &nbsp; **Description.**\n",
    "  - The Smartcab operates in a grid world with road directions 'North-South' and 'East-West'.\n",
    "  - There are many vehicles on the roads, but no pedestrians. \n",
    "  - In this world traffic lights are situated at each intersection, they can be in one of two states: 'North-South open' or 'East-West open'.\n",
    "  - US right-of-way rules:\n",
    "    - The light is green. \n",
    "      - The agent can choose the action of moving forward or turning right.\n",
    "      - If it wants to turn left, \n",
    "      but there is an oncoming car that is moving forward: the other car has the right of way. \n",
    "      - If there is no car oncoming, the learning agent may turn left.\n",
    "    - The light is red.\n",
    "     - The agent should not take the action of moving forward or turning left. \n",
    "     - It could turn right, but only if there is no car on the left, \n",
    "     or if there is a car on the left but it is not moving forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- &#x1F695; &nbsp; **Game options.**\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- &#x1F4B0; &nbsp; **Rewards.**\n",

    "The third step to creating an optimized Q-Learning agent is to begin implementing the functionality of Q-Learning itself. The concept of Q-Learning is fairly straightforward: For every state the agent visits, create an entry in the Q-table for all state-action pairs available. Then, when the agent encounters a state and performs an action, update the Q-value associated with that state-action pair based on the reward received and the interative update rule implemented. Of course, additional benefits come from Q-Learning, such that we can have the agent choose the *best* action for each state based on the Q-values of each state-action pair possible. For this project, you will be implementing a *decaying,* $\\epsilon$*-greedy* Q-learning algorithm with *no* discount factor. Follow the implementation instructions under each **TODO** in the agent functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the agent attribute `self.Q` is a dictionary: This is how the Q-table will be formed. Each state will be a key of the `self.Q` dictionary, and each value will then be another dictionary that holds the *action* and *Q-value*. Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "{ 'state-1': { 'action-1' : Qvalue-1, 'action-2' : Qvalue-2, ...},\n",
    "  'state-2': {'action-1' : Qvalue-1, ...},\n",
    "   ...}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, note that you are expected to use a *decaying* $\\epsilon$ *(exploration) factor*. Hence, as the number of trials increases, $\\epsilon$ should decrease towards 0. This is because the agent is expected to learn from its behavior and begin acting on its learned behavior. Additionally, The agent will be tested on what it has learned after $\\epsilon$ has passed a certain threshold (the default threshold is 0.01). For the initial Q-Learning implementation, you will be implementing a linear decaying function for $\\epsilon$."

    "The third step to creating an optimized Q-Learning agent is to perform the optimization! Now that the Q-Learning algorithm is implemented and the driving agent is successfully learning, it's necessary to tune settings and adjust learning paramaters so the driving agent learns both **safety** and **efficiency**. Typically this step will require a lot of trial and error, as some settings will invariably make the learning worse. One thing to keep in mind is the act of learning itself and the time that this takes: In theory, we could allow the agent to learn for an incredibly long amount of time; however, another goal of Q-Learning is to *transition from experimenting with unlearned behavior to acting on learned behavior*. For example, always allowing the agent to perform a random action during training (if $\\epsilon = 1$ and never decays) will certainly make it *learn*, but never let it *act*. When improving on your Q-Learning implementation, consider the impliciations it creates and whether it is logistically sensible to make a particular adjustment."

    "### 7.1 Improved Q-Learning Simulation Results\n",
    "To obtain results from the initial Q-Learning implementation, you will need to adjust the following flags and setup:\n",
    "- `'enforce_deadline'` - Set this to `True` to force the driving agent to capture whether it reaches the destination in time.\n",
    "- `'update_delay'` - Set this to a small value (such as `0.01`) to reduce the time between steps in each trial.\n",
    "- `'log_metrics'` - Set this to `True` to log the simluation results as a `.csv` file and the Q-table as a `.txt` file in `/logs/`.\n",
    "- `'learning'` - Set this to `'True'` to tell the driving agent to use your Q-Learning implementation.\n",
    "- `'optimized'` - Set this to `'True'` to tell the driving agent you are performing an optimized version of the Q-Learning implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional flags that can be adjusted as part of optimizing the Q-Learning agent:\n",
    "- `'n_test'` - Set this to some positive number (previously 10) to perform that many testing trials.\n",
    "- `'alpha'` - Set this to a real number between 0 - 1 to adjust the learning rate of the Q-Learning algorithm.\n",
    "- `'epsilon'` - Set this to a real number between 0 - 1 to adjust the starting exploration factor of the Q-Learning algorithm.\n",
    "- `'tolerance'` - set this to some small value larger than 0 (default was 0.05) to set the epsilon threshold for testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, use a decaying function of your choice for $\\epsilon$ (the exploration factor). Note that whichever function you use, it **must decay to **`'tolerance'`** at a reasonable rate**. The Q-Learning agent will not begin testing until this occurs. Some example decaying functions (for $t$, the number of trials):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\epsilon = a^t, \\textrm{for } 0 < a < 1 \\hspace{50px}\\epsilon = \\frac{1}{t^2}\\hspace{50px}\\epsilon = e^{-at}, \\textrm{for } 0 < a < 1 \\hspace{50px} \\epsilon = \\cos(at), \\textrm{for } 0 < a < 1$$\n",
    "You may also use a decaying function for $\\alpha$ (the learning rate) if you so choose, however this is typically less common. If you do so, be sure that it adheres to the inequality $0 \\leq \\alpha \\leq 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have difficulty getting your implementation to work, try setting the `'verbose'` flag to `True` to help debug. Flags that have been set here should be returned to their default setting when debugging. It is important that you understand what each flag does and how it affects the simulation! \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have successfully completed the improved Q-Learning simulation, run the code cell below to visualize the results. Note that log files are overwritten when identical simulations are run, so be careful with what log file is being loaded!"

    "### 7.2 Define an Optimal Policy\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, the answer to the important question *\"what am I trying to get my agent to learn?\"* only has a theoretical answer and cannot be concretely described. Here, however, you can concretely define what it is the agent is trying to learn, and that is the U.S. right-of-way traffic laws. Since these laws are known information, you can further define, for each state the *Smartcab* is occupying, the optimal action for the driving agent based on these laws. In that case, we call the set of optimal state-action pairs an **optimal policy**. Hence, unlike some theoretical answers, it is clear whether the agent is acting \"incorrectly\" not only by the reward (penalty) it receives, but also by pure observation. If the agent drives through a red light, we both see it receive a negative reward but also know that it is not the correct behavior. This can be used to your advantage for verifying whether the **policy** your driving agent has learned is the correct one, or if it is a **suboptimal policy**."

    "Curiously, as part of the Q-Learning algorithm, you were asked to **not** use the discount factor, `'gamma'` in the implementation. Including future rewards in the algorithm is used to aid in propogating positive rewards backwards from a future state to the current state. Essentially, if the driving agent is given the option to make several actions to arrive at different states, including future rewards will bias the agent towards states that could provide even more rewards. An example of this would be the driving agent moving towards a goal: With all actions and rewards equal, moving towards the goal would theoretically yield better rewards if there is an additional reward for reaching the goal. However, even though in this project, the driving agent is trying to reach a destination in the allotted time, including future rewards will not benefit the agent. In fact, if the agent were given many trials to learn, it could negatively affect Q-values!"
