    "In this project, we will work towards constructing an optimized Q-Learning driving agent that will navigate a *Smartcab* through its environment towards a goal. Since the *Smartcab* is expected to drive passengers from one location to another, the driving agent will be evaluated on two very important metrics: **Safety** and **Reliability**. A driving agent that gets the *Smartcab* to its destination while running red lights or narrowly avoiding accidents would be considered **unsafe**. Similarly, a driving agent that frequently fails to reach the destination in time would be considered **unreliable**. Maximizing the driving agent's **safety** and **reliability** would ensure that *Smartcabs* have a permanent place in the transportation industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Safety** and **Reliability** are measured using a letter-grade system as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Grade \t| Safety \t| Reliability \t|\n",
    "|:-----:\t|:------:\t|:-----------:\t|\n",
    "|   A+  \t|  Agent commits no traffic violations,<br/>and always chooses the correct action. | Agent reaches the destination in time<br />for 100% of trips. |\n",
    "|   A   \t|  Agent commits few minor traffic violations,<br/>such as failing to move on a green light. | Agent reaches the destination on time<br />for at least 90% of trips. |\n",
    "|   B   \t| Agent commits frequent minor traffic violations,<br/>such as failing to move on a green light. | Agent reaches the destination on time<br />for at least 80% of trips. |\n",
    "|   C   \t|  Agent commits at least one major traffic violation,<br/> such as driving through a red light. | Agent reaches the destination on time<br />for at least 70% of trips. |\n",
    "|   D   \t| Agent causes at least one minor accident,<br/> such as turning left on green with oncoming traffic.       \t| Agent reaches the destination on time<br />for at least 60% of trips. |\n",
    "|   F   \t|  Agent causes at least one major accident,<br />such as driving through a red light with cross-traffic.      \t| Agent fails to reach the destination on time<br />for at least 60% of trips. |\n",
    "\n",
    "To assist evaluating these important metrics, you will need to load visualization code that will be used later on in the project. Run the code cell below to import this code which is required for your analysis."

    "The third step to creating an optimized Q-Learning agent is to begin implementing the functionality of Q-Learning itself. The concept of Q-Learning is fairly straightforward: For every state the agent visits, create an entry in the Q-table for all state-action pairs available. Then, when the agent encounters a state and performs an action, update the Q-value associated with that state-action pair based on the reward received and the interative update rule implemented. Of course, additional benefits come from Q-Learning, such that we can have the agent choose the *best* action for each state based on the Q-values of each state-action pair possible. For this project, you will be implementing a *decaying,* $\\epsilon$*-greedy* Q-learning algorithm with *no* discount factor.

Additionally, The agent will be tested on what it has learned after $\\epsilon$ has passed a certain threshold (the default threshold is 0.01).

    "The third step to creating an optimized Q-Learning agent is to perform the optimization! Now that the Q-Learning algorithm is implemented and the driving agent is successfully learning, it's necessary to tune settings and adjust learning paramaters so the driving agent learns both **safety** and **efficiency**. Typically this step will require a lot of trial and error, as some settings will invariably make the learning worse. One thing to keep in mind is the act of learning itself and the time that this takes: In theory, we could allow the agent to learn for an incredibly long amount of time; however, another goal of Q-Learning is to *transition from experimenting with unlearned behavior to acting on learned behavior*. For example, always allowing the agent to perform a random action during training (if $\\epsilon = 1$ and never decays) will certainly make it *learn*, but never let it *act*. When improving on your Q-Learning implementation, consider the impliciations it creates and whether it is logistically sensible to make a particular adjustment."

    "\n",
    "Sometimes, the answer to the important question *\"what am I trying to get my agent to learn?\"* only has a theoretical answer and cannot be concretely described. Here, however, you can concretely define what it is the agent is trying to learn, and that is the U.S. right-of-way traffic laws. Since these laws are known information, you can further define, for each state the *Smartcab* is occupying, the optimal action for the driving agent based on these laws. In that case, we call the set of optimal state-action pairs an **optimal policy**. Hence, unlike some theoretical answers, it is clear whether the agent is acting \"incorrectly\" not only by the reward (penalty) it receives, but also by pure observation. If the agent drives through a red light, we both see it receive a negative reward but also know that it is not the correct behavior. This can be used to your advantage for verifying whether the **policy** your driving agent has learned is the correct one, or if it is a **suboptimal policy**."

Including future rewards in the algorithm is used to aid in propogating positive rewards backwards from a future state to the current state. Essentially, if the driving agent is given the option to make several actions to arrive at different states, including future rewards will bias the agent towards states that could provide even more rewards. An example of this would be the driving agent moving towards a goal: With all actions and rewards equal, moving towards the goal would theoretically yield better rewards if there is an additional reward for reaching the goal. However, even though in this project, the driving agent is trying to reach a destination in the allotted time, including future rewards will not benefit the agent.
